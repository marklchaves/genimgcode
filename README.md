# genimgcode

## Description

Generate markup to display images on web pages by reading a directory (folder) of prepared images. Current iteration is written in PHP.

Based on [Gallery From Folder by David Carr](https://daveismyname.blog/creating-an-image-gallery-from-a-folder-of-images-automatically).

This is a work in progress.
