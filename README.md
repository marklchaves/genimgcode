# genimgcode

## Description

Generate markup to display images on web pages by reading a directory (folder) of prepared images.

Based on [Gallery From Folder by David Carr](https://daveismyname.blog/creating-an-image-gallery-from-a-folder-of-images-automatically).

This is a work in progress.

## Output Formats

1. HTML
2. Liquid front matter for the Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme. My [main portfolio site](https://caughtmyeye.dev) is built on Jekyll.
